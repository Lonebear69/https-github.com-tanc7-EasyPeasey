# Update, New Installation Method, Python-AutoInstaller

Due to some weird bug where git cloning does not pull the latest version, I had to use a python auto-installer script to make it work. 
This python script will automatically perform the correct settings to keep the git submodules updated and pull the latest version.

Following the following steps, from terminal:

>cd /tmp

>git clone https://github.com/tanc7/EasyPeasey

>cd EasyPeasey

>python setup_Easy_Peasey.py

Then go grab a coffee.
